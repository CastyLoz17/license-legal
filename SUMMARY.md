# the "free for everyone except scammers" license

## formally known as the Non-Commercial Use License with Commercial Exception Clause (NCLCE)

**aka CC BY-NC-SA but with extra bite**

Copyright (c) 2025 Kaemori Yozzan, contact@sillyy.gay

**IMPORTANT: this is a human-readable summary. the actual license is at https://copyright.sillyy.gay**

## the vibe:

this is FREE SOFTWARE. if someone charged you for this, you got SCAMMED and i'm sorry bestie </3

## what you CAN do:

-   ✅ use it (go absolutely feral)
-   ✅ copy it (share with everyone)
-   ✅ modify it (make it better, worse, or cursed)
-   ✅ remix it (mash it with other stuff)
-   ✅ redistribute it (spread the chaos)
-   ✅ post it everywhere (shout from the rooftops)

## what you CANNOT do:

-   ❌ **sell it** (charging money for this = scamming and i will be sad)
-   ❌ **sell modified versions** (still scamming!! a few tweaks don't make it yours to sell)
-   ❌ **put it behind a paywall** (no paywalls, no "premium versions", fuck off)
-   ❌ **use it commercially without asking me first** (read below for how to ask nicely)

## the actual rules:

1. **give credit** - say "made by Kaemori" somewhere visible. link back if you can. don't steal credit like a goblin.

2. **share modifications under this same license** - if you change it and share it, it stays non-commercial and free. the protection carries forward >:3

3. **include this license** - copy this whole thing into your version. keep the chain alive.

4. **NO COMMERCIAL USE without permission** - this means:
    - can't sell it
    - can't use it in paid products/services
    - can't monetize it
    - can't use it for business stuff
    - basically if money's involved, email me first

## "but i'm not a scammer, i just need commercial use":

**email me at contact@sillyy.gay** and tell me:

-   who you are
-   what you wanna do with it
-   why you need commercial rights
-   proof you're not trying to scam anyone

if you're legit and not shady, **i'll probably say yes!!** i just wanna keep this FREE and stop it ending up on "shadysite.com $29.99" or whatever.

### the legal bits about custom commercial licenses:

-   i can give you a separate commercial license via email
-   i can revoke it if you do sketchy shit or drift from what we agreed on
-   it's specific to YOU and what we discussed
-   lying about your usage = instant revocation + possible legal consequences
-   doesn't transfer if you sell your company

### if i revoke your license:

**default:** you get **30 days** to either remove my code from paid stuff OR make it free

**BUT** we can negotiate a longer deadline if you need it (client contracts, migration stuff, whatever). email me, i'm reasonable.

i might even temporarily ignore continued use if you're being responsible and treating users right.

**HOWEVER** - just because i'm being nice doesn't mean the revocation is cancelled. if you start enshittifying or screwing over users, i can immediately enforce with zero warning. my patience ≠ waiving my rights.

don't comply? that's copyright infringement and i can do the whole legal thing. please don't make me, just talk to me.

## the "don't sue me" part:

this software is "AS IS" - if it breaks, explodes, or becomes sentient, not my problem :3c

NO WARRANTY. it might work great, it might summon demons, who knows.

i'm NOT LIABLE for ANY DAMAGES. your stuff breaks? skill issue. use at your own risk.

## tl;dr:

FREE software. use it, mod it, share it - just don't sell it or scam people. wanna use it commercially? ask nicely, i'll probably say yes if you're cool.

keep it free. credit me. don't be a dick.
